This is a simple blockchain project implemented in Go. The application is embryonic and has been developed for educational purposes, providing a basic overview of how a blockchain works.

## Features

- Creating blocks with timestamp, data, and previous hash.
- Adding new blocks to the chain.
- Checking the validity of blocks and the chain.

## Project structure

- **main.go:** Contains the main logic of the application.
- **blockchain.go:** Defines the `Block` and `BlockChain` structures, as well as blockchain-related functions.
- **README.md:** This file.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/blockchain-go.git
    cd blockchain-go
    ```

2. Run the application:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

    You can add data to the blocks as command line arguments.
